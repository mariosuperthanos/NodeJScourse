I created a new "Dev" environment that has 2 variables:
  - URL: http://127.0.0.1:8000/, replacing the host address with {{URL}}
  - jwt: the current token that will be saved as an environment variable. 
    Scripts tab for UPDATING THE ENVIRONMENTAL jwt var:
    pm.environment.set("jwt", pm.response.json().token);
  I specified in the Authorization tab of the PROTECTED route:
  Inheritance::
      Auth type: Bearer Token 
      Token: {{jwt}}
